""" The EfficientNet Family in PyTorch

An implementation of EfficienNet that covers variety of related models with efficient architectures:

* EfficientNet-V2
  - `EfficientNetV2: Smaller Models and Faster Training` - https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00298

* EfficientNet (B0-B8, L2 + Tensorflow pretrained AutoAug/RandAug/AdvProp/NoisyStudent weight ports)
  - EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for CNNs - https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946
  - CondConv: Conditionally Parameterized Convolutions for Efficient Inference - https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04971
  - Adversarial Examples Improve Image Recognition - https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09665
  - Self-training with Noisy Student improves ImageNet classification - https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04252

* MixNet (Small, Medium, and Large)
  - MixConv: Mixed Depthwise Convolutional Kernels - https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09595

* MNasNet B1, A1 (SE), Small
  - MnasNet: Platform-Aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile - https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626

* FBNet-C
  - FBNet: Hardware-Aware Efficient ConvNet Design via Differentiable NAS - https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03443

* Single-Path NAS Pixel1

* TinyNet
    - Model Rubik's Cube: Twisting Resolution, Depth and Width for TinyNets - https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14819
    - Definitions & weights borrowed from https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones/tree/master/tinynet_pytorch

* And likely more...

The majority of the above models (EfficientNet*, MixNet, MnasNet) and original weights were made available
by Mingxing Tan, Quoc Le, and other members of their Google Brain team. Thanks for consistently releasing
the models and weights open source!
